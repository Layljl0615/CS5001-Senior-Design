Different from most peers, I did not pursue undergraduate study immediately after high school education. Instead, I chose to firstly learn computer technology at Aptech Vocational School. In the same year, I also won a valuable internship opportunity in Beijing LeftBrain company where I was mainly responsible for the testing and debugging of APPs. Via this internship, I stirred up a stronger desire to delve into the CS domain deeply. Hence, I afterwards received a systematic undergraduate education in computer science at the University of Cincinnati. During the period, I have gotten exposed to and exerted a positive impact on a series of research projects concerning image analysis, AI automobile and 3D scene design. Through intensive research engagements, I have motivated an ever-growing interest in CS, and conceived wide-ranging technological applications in my mind, such as campus AI camera for the recognition of strangers entering campus, shared private car rental App and predicting the rise and fall of stock prices through AI. I have clearly realized only equipping myself with higher-level CS technologies can I make these innovative ideas come true.
Driven by abiding interest in CS, I have done my utmost to advance my study in this field. In the courses of Data Structure and Design & Analysis of Algorithms, I learned tree structures and algorithm design. Besides, by signing up for Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Applications, I have mastered the fundamentals and specific technology in AI. To further my study in AI and data mining, I proactively attended Dr. Gowtham Atluriâ€™s postgraduate course Intelligent Data Analysis and positively consulted the professor about the applications of decision-making trees in specific work and life. Learning with postgraduate students has not only enriched my expertise in data mining and machine learning, but also made me better at cooperating with and gaining inspiration from seniors. 

To put what I have learned into action, I independently accomplished a set of facial recognition programs in the context of Covid-19 outbreak worldwide. The programs were aimed to recognize whether users should wear face masks by VGG and OpenCV based on the training dataset of the MobileNetV2 model. Through this project, I have deepened my understanding about computer vision and truly felt how computer technology benefits this society.
