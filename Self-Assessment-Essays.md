Different from most peers, I did not pursue undergraduate study immediately after high school education. Instead, I chose to firstly learn computer technology at Aptech Vocational School. In the same year, I also won a valuable internship opportunity in Beijing LeftBrain company where I was mainly responsible for the testing and debugging of APPs. Via this internship, I stirred up a stronger desire to delve into the CS domain deeply. Hence, I afterwards received a systematic undergraduate education in computer science at the University of Cincinnati. During the period, I have gotten exposed to and exerted a positive impact on a series of research projects concerning image analysis, AI automobile and 3D scene design. Through intensive research engagements, I have motivated an ever-growing interest in CS, and conceived wide-ranging technological applications in my mind, such as campus AI camera for the recognition of strangers entering campus, shared private car rental App and predicting the rise and fall of stock prices through AI. I have clearly realized only equipping myself with higher-level CS technologies can I make these innovative ideas come true.
