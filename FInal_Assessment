As I am the only one team member in my team, so I did everything for this project. I learned a lot by doing a project from start to finish. I did a lot of research on VGG in fall semester, but finally I didnâ€™t use it in my project, because the program always reports an error after I try to join VGG, so I gave it up decisively.
	
Because of this project, I learnt a lot of knowledge about Deep Learning and It fascinates me and makes me want to spend more time learning about it. After I finished this project I feel very confidence about my knowledge. And In the future If I have an opportunity to do the similar project, I will be more comfortable.
