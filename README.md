## Project Abstract:
To put what I have learned into action, I independently accomplished a set of facial recognition programs in the context of Covid-19 outbreak worldwide. The programs were aimed to recognize whether users should wear face masks by VGG and OpenCV based on the training dataset of the MobileNetV2 model. Through this project, I have deepened my understanding about computer vision and truly felt how computer technology benefits this society.

## Project Description:
My senior design project is an application of face mask recognition. This is an application to check if anyone in the crowd is not wearing a mask. Generally, manual supervision is used to check whether the crowd is wearing masks. My senior design uses deep learning models to detect whether the crowd is wearing a mask. Application scenarios include public transportation, factory, hospitals, schools(UC) and shopping mall(kroger, casio). This project uses the MobileNetV2 algorithm to train the training set and then use VGG and SSD algorithm for target detection.
